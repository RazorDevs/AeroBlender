# Aeroblender

**Aeroblender** is an **API** based on [Terrablender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender), used for adding biomes in a simple and compatible manner with Aether's biome/terrain system.

It is recommended to make use of this API for Aether related addons, to ensure compatibility between other biomes added by other mods.

## How do I use it?

Aeroblender is used exactly like Terrablender, but be sure to use "AetherRegionType.THE_AETHER" in the definition of your mod's region.
